-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
With testing through unit, integration or end to end, this will validate the functionality of the code under different scenarios. Detailed review of code with your team mates can identify potential issues that may occur and ensure quality is practiced. Static analysis or dynamic analysis will use tools to identify any potential vulnerabilities or simulate real work attacks to then review and fix. Authentication and authorization of course needs to be practice because these mechanisms are meant to control access and protect any sensitive data and with regular updates, keeping all libraries, frameworks, and dependencies up to date to address known security vulnerabilities.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Being detailed in your requirement gathering and engaging with users or stakeholders to gather detailed requirements, understanding their needs and expectations in the beginning would be essential to understanding what would be expected. Creating use cases that could showcase what it will do in real life scenarios can assist also. Getting feedback from different users during the development phase to tune any inputs to enhance their experience. 

-How do I approach designing software?
I go into deep analysis of what is the requirements and what is expected to gain a better understanding of what is needed to be done. It is best to then create a high-level architecture that outlines the components, their interactions, and data flows. Then to approach in components versus doing everything all at once, this will promote reusability, maintainability and ensure nothing is overlooked.
